# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is focused on building a movie recommendation system using a dataset containing information on various movies. The system leverages key features like genre, language, popularity, and user ratings to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes 10,000 movie entries with the following features:

- **id**: Unique identifier for each movie.
- **title**: The title of the movie.
- **genre**: The genre of the movie (e.g., Action, Comedy).
- **original_language**: The original language in which the movie was produced.
- **overview**: A brief summary of the movie.
- **popularity**: A score indicating the movie's popularity.
- **release_date**: The date the movie was released.
- **vote_average**: The average rating of the movie.
- **vote_count**: The number of votes the movie received.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and experiment with the movie recommendation system, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`







## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded and basic information about the data is explored.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing a recommendation model using techniques like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid models.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the model using various metrics.

## Usage

To use the movie recommendation system:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `MovieRecommSystem.ipynb`.
4. Follow the notebook instructions to train the model and get movie recommendations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Incorporate User Ratings**: Add user-specific ratings to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
- **Advanced Models**: Experiment with more complex models like neural networks for recommendations.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web interface for easy interaction with the recommendation system.
